🔺 Rotating Triangle with Bouncing Ball – HTML5 Canvas Demo
This interactive web animation features a dynamically rotating equilateral triangle and a bouncing colored ball that responds to collision physics in real time. Built entirely with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, this project demonstrates smooth rendering, vector reflection, and geometric transformations — all in a browser-friendly format.

✨ Features
🌀 Rotating triangle at the center of the canvas

🟢 A bouncing ball that changes color when it hits the triangle edges

⏸️ Start/Pause button for animation control

🎮 Keyboard controls to adjust triangle rotation speed (← slow down, → speed up)

📱 Mobile-responsive design – scales beautifully on all screen sizes

⚙️ Built with no external libraries – just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

🧠 Educational Use
This project is ideal for:

Teaching 2D geometry and physics

Exploring collision detection and vector math

Demonstrating real-time animation in the browser
